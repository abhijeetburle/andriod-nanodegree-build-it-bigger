### Step 0: Starting Point

This is the starting point for the final project, which is provided to you in the [course repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud867/tree/master/FinalProject).
It contains an activity with a banner ad and a button that purports to tell a
joke, but actually just complains. The banner ad was set up following the
instructions here:

https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/admob/android/quick-start

You may need to download the Google Repository from the Extras section of the
Android SDK Manager.

When you can build an deploy this starter code to an emulator, you're ready to
move on.
